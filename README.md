# ETL-Traffic

Welcome to our ETL Project Webpage!

Our topic is about Human Trafficking in the United Kingdom between years 2014 to 2016.

This project provides us the platform to demonastrate our ability to Extract, Transform and Load data from various resources and put them into a database. In our case into MySQL.
