# ETL-Traffic

Welcome to our ETL Project Webpage!

Our topic is about Human Trafficking in the United Kingdom between years 2014 to 2016.

The purpose of this project is for us to demonastrate our ability to Extract, Transform and Load data from various resources in order to load it into a database.
